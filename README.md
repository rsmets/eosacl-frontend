## Usage

Must have an EOS account with keys kept in a Scatter wallet.

## FAQ

What does it solve? There is no central service or data store with all of your access credentials and access history.

Who would use this? Individuals or organizations that are sensitive to the security concerns of giving authoritative control to a ACL service provider.

Why do I need a Scatter wallet? It keeps your EOS account keys secure while handling signing transactions (access shares, revokes, logs, etc).

Where is the access list stored? Publicly in the EOS myeosacldapp smart contract. Access logs are stored publicly as transactions on chain.
